TestImageView
=============

Repo to debug the download of parse files
This is a very simple project with one view which has 2 image views.
One of the image views gets the image from a parse file url and another one froma non-files.parse.com url.
This is to confirm that files.parse.com urls don't time out when trying to fetch data from them.
